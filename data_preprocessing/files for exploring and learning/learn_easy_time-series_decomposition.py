'''Time series decomposition is a technique that splits a time series into several components, each representing an underlying pattern category, trend, seasonality, and noise. In this tutorial, we will show you how to automatically decompose a time series with Python.

To begin with, let's talk a bit about the components of a time series:

Seasonality: describes the periodic signal in your time series.
Trend: describes whether the time series is decreasing, constant, or increasing over time.
Noise: describes what remains behind the separation of seasonality and trend from the time series. In other words, itâ€™s the variability in the data that cannot be explained by the model.

For this example, we will use the Air Passengers Data from Kaggle.'''
