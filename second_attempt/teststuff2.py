'''
To identify the conspicuous peaks on a line graph using NumPy and SciPy, you can use the find_peaks function from SciPy's signal module. This function can detect peaks (local maxima) in a signal, based on their prominence and width.

We then use find_peaks to find the peaks in the signal, by specifying a prominence threshold of 0.5 and a width threshold of 5. These thresholds control the sensitivity of the peak detection algorithm. A higher prominence value will only identify peaks that are more prominent (i.e., larger), while a higher width value will only identify peaks that are wider.

We then plot the signal and the detected peaks using Matplotlib's plot function. The detected peaks are marked with red crosses ("x").

You can adjust the prominence and width thresholds to suit your needs. Increasing the prominence value will result in fewer but more prominent peaks being detected, while increasing the width value will result in fewer but wider peaks being detected.'''
